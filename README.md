# Bank Tech Test in Javascript

# To Start

Clone the repository from [https://github.com/GeorgeDainton/bank] and switch into the directory

# Setup our environment to use node latest version
$ nvm use node

# Initialise the NPM project (this will create a file package.json)
$ npm init -y

# Add the jest package to our project
# (this will update package.json and package-lock.json)
$ npm add jest

# Also install jest "globally"
# (this is so we can run the `jest` command)
$ npm install -g jest


# How to Use

This is a bank account app that can be run from the command line using node

1. Start node using the command $ node in the terminal
2. Copy the contents of bankAccount.js from lines 1 to 55 and paste into the node terminal, and press enter. This will laod the code so it's ready to use
3. Create a new instance of the BankAccount class using:
```
const bankAccount = new BankAccount

```
4. All new BankAccount instances have a balance of 0 and and empty transactions array
5. To deposit money, use the .deposit method and pass it a positive integer as an argument
```
bankAccount.deposit(500000)

```
6. To withdraw money, use the .transact method and pass it a positive integer as an argument
```
bankAccount.withdraw(200000)

```
7. Call .printStatement() on the account to see a list of all transaction with dates, amounts, whether they were credit credit or debit, and the resulting balance changes. The separating lines between columns are straightest when 6 digits integers are used. Please feel free to use the exmaple transactions below:
```
bankAccount.deposit(909486)
bankAccount.withdraw(888993)
bankAccount.deposit(658677)
bankAccount.deposit(794867)
bankAccount.withdraw(448677)
bankAccount.printStatement()

Expected output:

'date         || credit || debit || balance\n' +
  '21/06/2022 || 909486 ||       || 909486\n' +
  '21/06/2022 ||        || 888993|| 820493\n' +
  '21/06/2022 || 658677 ||       || 1479170\n' +
  '21/06/2022 || 794867 ||       || 2274037\n' +
  '21/06/2022 ||        || 448677|| 2225360\n'

```
9. An error will be thrown if there are insufficient funds in the account i.e if the user tries to withdraw past 0

10. I have an alternate version on the transaction branch, which uses a single transact method with negative and positive intgers instead of deposit and withdraw methods. Use the command: 
```
git checkout transact 

```

if you would like to try it out.

# Approach

I decided to structure my code as a single class because the program is simple enough to be able to carry out the three tasks of adding and subtracting funds and printing statements without extracting functionality to other classes. It is much easier to read this way, and I sought to keep the program as simple as possible
